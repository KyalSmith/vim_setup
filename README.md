# vim_setup
python script to setup vim as an IDE for python

Requirements:
python3 pip module must be installed

sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y


Simply place the 3 files above in your home folder.
Then run the load_vim_libs.py using python3 with root access(sudo).

NOTE! if you have existing an existing vimrc file, make a backup of that as the load_vim_libs file
will overwrite it.
